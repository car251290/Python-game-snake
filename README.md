## The snake game for children in Python
The player is represented as snake, which grows if it eats an apple. 
The goal of the game is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding into yourself. 
This is very easy in the early phase of the game but is increasingly more difficult as the length of the snake grows.

The problem is response time. If you run the code below, you'll see that the snake responds to key presses, but not for a couple of - I'll call them frames - after the press. I don't quite understand how the listen() method works; am I using it properly? If not, how should I use it, and if so, how can I fix the delay? I know about Pygame, but a) I can't find an easy to install 64 bit version for python 3.4
